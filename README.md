# Cypress, Gherkin, and TypeScript Web Testing

## This project serves as a demonstration of BDD-style automated testing using modern tools. It is intended for my own educational and portfolio purposes. I will be continuously adding to this.

## Technologies Used

- **Cypress** – End-to-end testing framework for web applications
- **Gherkin** – Syntax for writing human-readable feature specifications
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed language for scalable test logic

## Project Structure

- `features/` – Gherkin feature files describing test scenarios
- `step-definitions/` – TypeScript implementations of Gherkin steps
- `cypress/` – Cypress configuration and support files
- `tests/` – Additional TypeScript-based test logic and utilities

## Getting Started

To run the tests locally:

1. Install Cypress, Gherkin, Typescript
2.
